# Data-Structures C++
This is a repository of data structures written in C++.
This repo provides the basic requirements to understand and implement these data structures using any language of your choosing.
The data structures are written in C++ because for me this language has been my first OOP language and I started learn data structures with it.

Here is the list of data structures:
- Double Linked List;
- Stack;
- Queue;
- HashTable;
- N-ary Tree;
- Binary Tree;
- Search Binary Tree;
- Priority QUeue;
- Graph.

Later I will give an explanation of the implementation of each of them.
